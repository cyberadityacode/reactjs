Obejective: To allow child component to communicate with parent components

> Utility

- **Form handling** - passing event handlers like onChange, onSubmit to form components allows the child components to update the form data and notify the parent components of the changes.
        
    
- **User Interactions**: button click to open models or navigating to different pages.
        
- **State Management**: Update state in parent components, which can be passed down to child components as a props to reflect the updated state.
        
- **Callback functions**: event handlers can be used as callback function to handle asynchronous operations or to update state based on the result of operations.
