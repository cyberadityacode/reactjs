- In React, a component is a reusable and independent building block that divides the user interface (UI) into smaller, manageable parts. 

- Components allow developers to encapsulate specific functionality or sections of the UI, making it easier to develop, maintain, and reuse code. 

> There are two main types of components in React:
1. Function Components:

These are simpler and often preferred for basic UI elements. They are JavaScript functions that accept props (input data) as arguments and return JSX (HTML-like syntax) to render the UI.

2. Class Components:
These are more complex and offer additional features like state management and lifecycle methods. They are defined as JavaScript classes that extend the React.Component class and have a render() method to return JSX.
