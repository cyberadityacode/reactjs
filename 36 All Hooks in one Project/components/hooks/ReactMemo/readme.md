Changing **where** you place the `console.log` affects the **order of output**, but it does **not** change the **rendering or effect execution order**, just what you see in the console.

Let’s break this down:

---

### 🔁 Scenario A: Logging inside `useEffect` in both Parent and Child

#### Code:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Hello from...");
}, []);
```

#### Console Output:

```
Hello from Child Component
Hello From Parent Component
```

**Why?**
Because `useEffect` runs **after the render** and in **depth-first order** — children before parents.

---

### 📤 Scenario B: Logging during render (outside `useEffect`)

If you move the `console.log` directly **into the render body**, like this:

```js
export default function ReactMemoFirstChild() {
    console.log("Rendering Child");
    return <div>...</div>;
}
```

and

```js
export default function ReactMemoFirst() {
    console.log("Rendering Parent");
    return (
      <div>
        <ReactMemoFirstChild />
      </div>
    );
}
```

#### Console Output:

```
Rendering Parent
Rendering Child
```

**Why?**
This reflects the **top-down rendering order**, because React renders the **parent first**, and then renders the child when it encounters it in the JSX tree.

---

### ✅ So to clarify:

| Where you put `console.log`           | Execution Order         | Console Log Order |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Inside `render` (outside `useEffect`) | Top-down                | Parent → Child    |
| Inside `useEffect`                    | Bottom-up (depth-first) | Child → Parent    |

---

### 💡 Final Insight

* **Rendering happens top-down**, so parent components render before their children.
* **`useEffect` executes after render**, and in **depth-first order** (so children’s effects run before parents’).

So, if your goal is to track render order → **log inside the render**.
If you're tracking side effects → **log inside `useEffect`**, and expect child-first logs.

---

Yes, your **observation is correct** — and it shows a good understanding of how **object references and React.memo** work.

Let's break it down clearly:

---

### ✅ The Problem:

You're passing this `personalInfo` object as a prop:

```js
const personalInfo = {
  name: "aditya dubey",
  age: 31,
}
```

But it's being **re-declared** inside the `PassingObjectReactMemo` component function, which means:

* **On every re-render of the parent**, a **new object reference** is created.
* Even if the values inside `personalInfo` haven't changed, the object reference has changed.
* **React.memo** performs a shallow comparison of props. Since the object reference is new, React thinks the prop changed, and re-renders the child.

---

### 🧠 What's Happening:

```jsx
<ReactMemoFirstChild message={message} personalInfo = {personalInfo} />
```

Even if `message` is the same, the `personalInfo` object is **new on every render**, so `React.memo` doesn't prevent re-rendering.

---

### ✅ Solutions:

#### 1. **Memoize the object with `useMemo`**

This keeps the same reference unless its dependencies change.

```js
const personalInfo = useMemo(() => ({
  name: "aditya dubey",
  age: 31,
}), []);
```

Now, the `personalInfo` reference will stay the same across renders unless dependencies (here `[]` — meaning "never") change.

#### 2. **Lift the object outside the component**

If the object is static:

```js
const personalInfo = {
  name: "aditya dubey",
  age: 31,
};

export default function PassingObjectReactMemo() {
  ...
  <ReactMemoFirstChild message={message} personalInfo={personalInfo} />
}
```

This ensures the object reference is stable.

---

### 💡 Summary:

* ✅ **Yes, object reference change causes re-render**, even with `React.memo`.
* 🔁 **React.memo does shallow comparison**, so only identical references prevent re-render.
* ✅ Use `useMemo` or move the object **outside the parent component** for consistent references.

---

## Can I use Object.freeze to freeze the personalInfo object, so that its reference doesn't alters?


Great question — and the short answer is:

### ❌ No, `Object.freeze` **does not** prevent reference change during re-renders.

---

### Here’s why:

```js
const personalInfo = Object.freeze({
  name: "aditya dubey",
  age: 31,
});
```

This **only freezes the contents** of the object — meaning:

* You **can’t mutate** `personalInfo.name = 'xyz'`
* But you're **still creating a new object** each time the component renders, so the **reference changes**.

Even if you freeze it:

```js
const personalInfo = Object.freeze({ name: 'aditya dubey', age: 31 });
```

On the next render, this line re-executes, creating a new object, then freezing it. So:

```js
console.log(prevPersonalInfo === currentPersonalInfo); // false
```

React.memo will still see this as a changed prop.

---

### ✅ Correct Solution

To truly **preserve the reference**, use:

#### ✅ `useMemo`

```js
const personalInfo = useMemo(() => Object.freeze({
  name: "aditya dubey",
  age: 31
}), []);
```

Now:

* The object is **frozen** (immutable)
* Its **reference is stable** across renders (thanks to `useMemo`)

Or, better yet, if it’s completely static:

#### ✅ Declare outside the component

```js
const personalInfo = Object.freeze({
  name: "aditya dubey",
  age: 31
});
```

This keeps the object out of React's rendering lifecycle entirely.

### 🧠 Summary

| Method             | Prevents Mutation | Prevents Reference Change |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| `Object.freeze`    | ✅ Yes             | ❌ No                      |
| `useMemo`          | ❌ No (by itself)  | ✅ Yes                     |
| `useMemo + freeze` | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes                     |
| Declare outside    | ✅ Yes (if frozen) | ✅ Yes                     |
