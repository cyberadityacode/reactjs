```jsx
<Component>
hi
</Component>
```

> we can access the hi with props.children

Summary: 
the children prop allows you to pass child elements directly into a component. It is used for:

1) Component Composition: Simplifies nesting components within each other.
2) Reusability: Enables the creation of reusable components that accept arbitrary content.
3) Layouts and Wrappers: Useful for creating components that wrap other elements.

You can access the children prop inside a component by using destructuring. children can be any valid React node, and you can conditionally render children based on logic.

## What's there for me?
1. Leveraged localStorage to set and getItem
2. useState to update the value of the component dynamically.
3. useHook to execute only when countValue changes â€” not on every render. (This helped to prevent NaN in this case)
4. Used Children Prop in Button Component.
5. Conditional Rendering use case.
6. Used Array of Range Object to traverse through array obj elements and output result on the basis of falling range. ( Eg. counter click value > 30 -> God Level Display)
7. Its utility array is wide - Leveling systems ,Grading systems, Feedback systems ðŸš€
