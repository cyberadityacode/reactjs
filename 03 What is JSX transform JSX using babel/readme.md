## What is JSX?

**JSX** stands for **JavaScript XML**.  
It's a **special syntax** used in React to write **HTML-like code inside JavaScript**.

### ✅ Example:
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

This **looks like HTML**, but it’s actually **JSX**.

Under the hood, it gets converted to:
```js
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
```

So JSX is just a **convenient way to write React elements** more clearly.

## What is Babel?

**Babel** is a **JavaScript compiler**.

One of its jobs is to **convert JSX into regular JavaScript** that browsers can understand.

### For example:
Babel takes this JSX:
```jsx
<div className="box">Hello</div>
```

And converts it into:
```js
React.createElement('div', { className: 'box' }, 'Hello');
```

It also:
- Converts **modern JavaScript (ES6+)** to older JS for browser support.
- Handles features like **arrow functions**, **classes**, **optional chaining**, etc.
