- Removed lineup management methods for simplicity

**Simplified Match Data Structure**:
```javascript
{
  // ... existing match fields
  ballHistory: [], // Array of ball records
  team1Score: {
    runs: 0,
    wickets: 0,
    overs: 0,
    balls: 0,
    extras: 0,
    fours: 0,
    sixes: 0
  }
  // ... similar for team2Score
}
```

## Usage Workflow

### 1. **Start Match**
Umpire clicks "Start Match" to change status from 'upcoming' to 'live'

### 2. **Begin Ball-by-Ball Scoring**
- Live matches immediately show the ball-by-ball scoring interface
- No setup required - start scoring right away
- Select ball type (runs, wicket, extras, etc.)
- Handle dismissals with detailed types
- Manage extras with additional runs

### 3. **Undo Mistakes**
- Click "Undo Last Ball" if you made an error
- Confirm the undo action in the modal
- Score automatically adjusts (runs, wickets, overs, balls)

### 4. **Innings Management**
- Switch innings when first innings completes
- Continue ball-by-ball scoring for second innings

### 5. **Match Completion**
- End match with final result
- Complete ball history preserved

## Technical Implementation

### Real-time Updates
```javascript
// Example ball update
const ballData = {
  type: 'runs',
  runs: 4,
  extras: 0,
  batsman: 'Player1',
  bowler: 'Bowler1',
  dismissal: null,
  ballNumber: 25,
  timestamp: '2024-01-01T10:30:00Z',
  innings: 1
};
```

### Score Calculation Logic
- **Regular Runs**: Add to score, increment ball count
- **Boundaries**: Add 4/6 runs, increment ball count
- **Wickets**: Increment wicket count, increment ball count
- **Wides/No-balls**: Add penalty + extra runs, don't increment ball count
- **Byes/Leg-byes**: Add runs to score, increment ball count

### Overs Management
- 6 balls = 1 over
- Ball count resets to 0 after 6 balls
- Over count increments by 1

## User Interface

### Ball Entry Buttons
- **Dot Ball**: Gray button for no runs
- **Runs (1-3)**: Green buttons for singles/doubles/triples  
- **FOUR**: Blue button for boundary
- **SIX**: Purple button for maximum
- **WICKET**: Red button (opens dismissal modal)
- **Extras**: Orange/Red buttons (opens extras modal)

### Score Display
- Large, prominent score display
- Current innings indicator
- Overs and balls count
- Current players information

### Ball History
- Last 10 balls displayed as colored circles
- Visual representation of ball outcomes
- Tooltip shows ball details on hover
- Total ball count displayed

### Undo Functionality
- Red "Undo Last Ball" button (only shown if balls exist)
- Confirmation modal with last ball details
- Safe undo with confirmation to prevent accidents

## Data Validation

### Input Validation
- Only authorized umpire can update scores
- Match must be in 'live' status
- Lineups must be complete before ball-by-ball scoring

### Score Integrity
- Automatic ball count management
- Proper extras handling
- Wicket validation (can't exceed 10)
- Over completion detection

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
1. **Multiple Ball Undo**: Ability to undo multiple balls at once
2. **Ball Editing**: Edit specific balls in history rather than just undo
3. **Player Statistics**: Individual batting/bowling stats (when needed)
4. **Partnership Tracking**: Current partnership runs and balls
5. **Match Commentary**: Ball-by-ball commentary entry
6. **Export Options**: PDF/Excel match reports

### Technical Improvements
1. **Offline Support**: Work without internet, sync when connected
2. **Voice Input**: Voice commands for faster ball entry
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick keys for common ball types
4. **Auto-save**: Automatic save every few balls
5. **Match Templates**: Pre-defined match formats and rules

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Score not updating**: Check umpire authorization and match status
2. **Ball history missing**: Verify Firebase connection and permissions
3. **Undo not working**: Ensure there are balls to undo and confirm action
4. **Score discrepancy**: Use undo functionality to correct recent errors

### Debug Tips
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify Firebase rules allow write access for umpires
- Ensure match is in 'live' status for ball-by-ball scoring
- Confirm user has umpire role assigned
- Use undo feature carefully - it cannot be reversed

This simplified ball-by-ball scoring system provides umpires with professional-grade tools for accurate, detailed cricket match recording with error correction capabilities, while maintaining real-time synchronization across all viewers.
