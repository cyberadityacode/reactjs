# Admin Access Issue - SOLVED! ✅

## Problem Description
When a new user signs up and tries to access the admin panel, they see:
```
Access Restricted
You don't have permission to access this page. Required roles: admin
Your current role: user
```

## ✅ Solution Implemented

The issue has been **FIXED**! The admin route now properly allows new users to access the admin setup process.

### What Was Changed:
- **Updated `/admin` route** in `App.jsx` to use `ProtectedRoute` instead of `RoleProtectedRoute`
- This allows the `AdminPanel` component to handle first-time admin setup internally
- The `AdminPanel` component already has built-in logic to show `AdminSetup` for non-admin users

## 🚀 How To Make Yourself Admin

### Step 1: Sign In
1. Open the cricket app in your browser
2. Sign in with your account (email/password or social login)

### Step 2: Access Admin Panel
1. Navigate to `/admin` in your browser URL bar, or
2. Add an "Admin" link to the navigation (it will appear after you become admin)

### Step 3: Complete Admin Setup
You'll see the **Admin Setup Required** page with:
- **"Make Me Admin"** button
- **Firestore rules setup instructions** (if needed)
- **Your current user information**

### Step 4: Click "Make Me Admin"
- Click the blue **"Make Me Admin"** button
- If successful, you'll see a success message
- If you get a permission error, follow the Firestore rules setup below

### Step 5: Refresh Page
- After successful admin assignment, refresh the page
- You'll now see the full Admin Panel with user management features

## 🔧 Firestore Rules Setup (If Needed)

If you see permission errors, update your Firestore security rules:

### 1. Go to Firebase Console
- Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/
- Select your project

### 2. Navigate to Firestore Rules
- Go to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**

### 3. Update Rules
Replace the current rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /matches/{matchId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /score_updates/{updateId} {
      allow read, create: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /user_activities/{activityId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Publish Rules
- Click **Publish** to apply the new rules

### 5. Try Again
- Return to your app and click "Make Me Admin" again
